📖 Problem Statement

In many educational institutions, student records and academic performance details are maintained manually. This approach is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient. There is a need for a simple, reliable digital system to manage student information and evaluate academic performance accurately.

🎯 Objective

To develop a Java-based desktop application that efficiently manages student records and calculates academic performance using:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

Java Swing for GUI

Exception handling

Multithreading for background operations

🛠️ Technologies Used
Component	Technology
Programming Language	Java (JDK 17)
IDE	Apache NetBeans IDE
GUI Framework	Java Swing
Database	MySQL (Optional – via JDBC)
Version Control	GitHub
✨ Features

Add student details (ID, Name, Course, Semester)

Enter marks for three subjects

Automatic calculation of:

Total Marks

Average Marks

Result (Pass / Distinction / Fail)

User-friendly graphical interface

Exception handling for invalid inputs

Multithreading for background database operations

🧩 OOP Concepts Implemented

Encapsulation

Private data members with getter and setter methods

Abstraction

Separate classes for marks calculation and performance evaluation

Polymorphism

Conditional logic used to evaluate student results

Classes & Objects

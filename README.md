Smart Student Record & Performance Management System
👨‍💻 Team Members
Nevin Kurian and Shijin C Mathew
📖 Problem Statement
In many educational institutions, student records and performance details are maintained manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. There is a need for a simple digital system to manage student details and evaluate academic performance efficiently.
🎯 Objective
To develop a Java-based application that manages student records and calculates academic performance using Object-Oriented Programming concepts, Java Swing GUI, exception handling, and multithreading.
🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java (JDK 8)
IDE: Apache NetBeans IDE
GUI: Java Swing
Database: MySQL (optional – via JDBC)
Version Control: GitHub
✨ Features
Add student details (ID, Name, Course, Semester)
Enter marks for three subjects
Automatic calculation of:
Total marks
Average
Result (Pass / Distinction / Fail)
User-friendly graphical interface
Exception handling for invalid inputs
Multithreading for background database operations
🧩 OOP Concepts Implemented
Encapsulation: Private data members with controlled access
Abstraction: Separate classes for marks and performance logic
Polymorphism: Conditional result evaluation logic
Classes & Objects: Student, Marks, Performance Report
▶️ How to Run the Project
Install JDK 8 and Apache NetBeans IDE
Open NetBeans → Create a Java Application
Add the file SmartStudentManagementSystem.java
Paste the source code
